                <p>Not much has changed in the wine making process since we started making wine 8000 years ago. There are some differences between red winemaking and white winemaking, with the primary difference being that red winemaking involves the fermentation of grapes with skin to dye it red, while white winemaking involves the fermentation of grapes without skin. Here are the winemaking steps for both red wines and white wines in more detail.</p>

                <p>Red wine is made with black (also known as purple) wine grapes. The <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/anthocyanins/" target="_blank">anthocyanin</a> (red pigment) found in the black grape skins gives the red wine its signature colour. The grapes have to be harvested at perfect ripeness in order for the grapes to be of the best quality, as grapes do not continue to ripen after they have been picked.</p>
                <p>Grapes that are picked too early may result in tart and thin-tasting wines, while grapes that are picked too late may result in wines that taste overly ripe and flabby. This just goes to show how important the grape harvest season is for winemakers, as it can make or break the harvest for that year.</p>

                <p>The harvested grapes are brought to the winery, where the winemaker decides whether to remove the stems or to ferment grape bunches as whole clusters.

                <p>Red wines ferment for an average of 5 to 21 days at 20 to 30 degrees Celsius and often get left to macerate on the grape skins for 7 to 28 days after the fermentation completes.</p>
                <p>The fermenting juice is frequently stirred to ensure that the skins are submerged, as they will gradually float to the surface over time. One way to achieve this is to pump wine over the top to push the skins down. This method rigourously extracts a large amount of flavour from the grape skins and results in rich red wines. Another way is to punch down the layer of floating skins. This method extracts flavours more delicately and results in more subtle red wines.</p>

                <p>The duration of the aging phase also greatly affects the taste of the wine. The longer the wine rests, the more chemical reactions happen within the vessel, which may result in a smoother and more nutty flavour.</p>

                <p>Depending on the wine, the winemaker may allow malolactic bacteria to convert sharp tasting malic acid into creamier, choclatey lactic acid. This lowers acidity, reduces fruitiness, and adds creamy buttery flavours to white wines.</p>

                <p>Although it is common to only use a single grape variety or wine from 1 tank to produce the white wine, the winemaker can still go through a barrel selection process to create the blend. As with red winemaking, this can pose a challenge for the winemaker, as they have to rely on their sense of texture on the palate instead of their nose, due to the fact that the aromas have not finished evolving.</p>
