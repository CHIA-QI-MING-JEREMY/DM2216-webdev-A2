                <p>There are some unusual and alternative uses for wine besides for drinking. The microbiology, alcohol, and chemical makeup enable a variety of applications in places such as the home and the kitchen.</p>

                <p>Wine is often recommended for deglazing for its ability to dissolve both oil and water compounds. Its acid can also help with the texture of dishes, such as with heavy cheese or dairy sauces. The acid in the wine binds with the calcium of the dairy, preventing coagulation, and the sauce remains fluid.</p>
                <p>While cooking with wine will often evaporate much of the alcohol, there will always be a small amount of alcohol left.</p>

                <p>The alcohol in wine is anti-bacterial, which makes it perfectly suitable for cleaning and disinfecting. Leftover wine can be used to wash vegetables, or even clean countertops or glass. However, it should not be used to clean surfaces that are easily corroded, such as granite, due to the fact that wine is highly acidic.</p>

                <p>Wine has a high concentration of nitrogen and yeast, which makes it very suitable for composting. Nitrogen is vitally important to the organic breakdown process of composting, and is also a nutrient for plant growth and production. Yeast adds to the microbiology cultivated in compost and helps to break down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin" target="_blank">lignin</a> found in wood or other carbon sources. The addition of wine also increases the moisture levels in the compost, which aids the process of decomposition. However, too much wine will make the compost too moist, and also introduce too much alcohol, which could kill off all the bacteria.</p>
