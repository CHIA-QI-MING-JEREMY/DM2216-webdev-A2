                <h1 class="center">Wine Classification</h1>
                <p>Wine can be classified based on numerous criteria. Here are some common classification criteria:</p>
            </div>

            <!-- colour container -->
            <div class="accordion">

                </div>
                <!-- category -->
                <div class="bodyText textWithImage">
                    <h1>Colour</h1>
                </div>
            </div>
            <!-- colour content -->
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Red Wine:</h2>
                <p>Red wine is fermented from grapes with skin. The longer the skin is immersed, the darker the colour of the red wine. Young red wines are typically deep purplish red or ruby red, while older red wines are garnet or brick red. The colour is also influenced by the varietals (specific named grape variety), such as Cabernet Sauvignon, which is of a darker colour.</p>
                <h2>White Wine:</h2>
                <p>White wine can be made from both white and red grapes. The grapes are pressed to remove the skins and seeds before they are fermented, preventing the extraction of pigment and tannins from the skins, which give red wines their colour. White wines are usually turquoise yellow, lemon yellow, golden yellow, amber, or brown.</p>
                <p>The colour can also be influenced by the varietals as well as the brewing techniques. For example, Chardonnay wine aged in oak barrels will be of a deeper golden colour, while Chardonnay wine not aged in oak barrels will be of a light lemon yellow colour.</p>
                <h2>Pink Wine:</h2>
                <p>Pink wine is made of red grape varieties after short-term impregnation and fermentation. Similarly to red wine, the longer the grapes are soaked, the darker the colour of the wine. The colour from shallow to deep is cherry powder, peach powder, peony red, coral red, and cherry red.</p>

                <h2>Still Wine</h2>
                <p>Most wines in the market today fall into this category. Such wines have a carbon dioxide pressure of less than 0.05 megapascals at 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
                <h2>Sparking Wine</h2>
                <p>Sparking wines can be split into low sparkling wine and high sparking wine. Low sparkling wines have a carbon dioxide pressure between 0.05 and 0.35 megapascals at 20 degrees Celsius, while high sparkling wines have a carbon dioxide pressure greater than 0.35 megapascals at 20 degrees Celsius. </p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>During the fermentation process, yeast will convert the sugar in the wine into alcohol. The sugar content of the wine is based on the residual unconverted sugar after fermentation, and categorised according to the carbon dioxide pressure.</p>
                <h2>Still Wine</h2>
                <p><strong>Dry:</strong> sugar content less than or equal to 4 grams per litre. Most common type on the market.</p>
                <p><strong>Semi-dry:</strong> sugar content between 4 to 12 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Semi-sweet:</strong> sugar content between 12 to 45 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Sweet:</strong> sugar content greater than 45 grams per litre.</p>
                <h2>Sparkling Wine</h2>
                <p><strong>Brut Nature:</strong> sugar content less than or equal to 3 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Extra Brut:</strong> sugar content less than or equal to 6 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Brut:</strong> less than or equal to 12 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Extra-dry:</strong> sugar content between 12 to 17 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Dry:</strong> sugar content between 17 to 32 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Semi-dry:</strong> sugar content between 32 to 50 grams per litre.</p>
                <p><strong>Sweet:</strong> sugar content greater than 50 grams per litre.</p>

                <h2>Light-bodied Wine</h2>
                <p>Light-bodied red wines are generally lighter in colour and have fewer tannins, such as Pinot Noir and Gamay. Light white wines tend to have a sharp acidity that makes them more refreshing when chilled, such as Pinot Gris, Albarino, and Muscadet.</p>
                <h2>Medium-bodied Wine</h2>
                <p>Medium-bodied wines tend to be darker and have more texture on the tongue. Red wines under this category include Merlot, Tempranillo, and Sangiovese. White wines under this category include Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc, and Trebbiano.</p>
                <h2>Full-bodied Wine</h2>
                <p>Full-bodied red and white wines have different textures even though they are both full-bodied wines. This means that red wines can only be compared with red wines, and white wines with white wines.Full-bodied red wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah/Shiraz, and Malbec are of the deepest colour with abundant tannins. Full-bodied white wines such as Chardonnay, Virognier, and Semillon are mostly aged in oak barrels, making them heavier.</p>

                <h2>Late Harvest Wine</h2>
                <p>Such wines are made from grapes that are harvested several days after they become naturally ripe. This results in the wine being sweeter and more flavourful.</p>
                <h2>Noble Rot Wine</h2>
                <p>Such wines are also made from grapes that are harvested several days after they become naturally ripe. However, the grapes are additionally infected with certain noble rot bacteria. This results in the grapes having extremely high sugar concentrations, and the wine being sweet with a distinct aroma of honey and dried fruit.</p>
                <h2>Ice Wine</h2>
                <p>Such wines are also made from grapes that are harvested several days after they become naturally ripe. However, the grapes are only harvested at temperatures of -7 to -8 degrees Celsius, and are pressed with ice to keep the wine fresh.</p>

                <h2>Aromatised Wine</h2>
                <p>These wines are made by steeping aromatic plants or adding extracts of aromatic plants.</p>
                <h2>Carbonated Wine</h2>
                <p>The carbon dioxide contained in these wines are either partially or entirely artifically added in order to produce wine with similar physical characteristics as sparkling wine.</p>
                <h2>Non-alcoholic Wine</h2>
                <p>Such wines are also known as "detoxified" wine. They are made using special processes in order to reduce the alcohol content to either 0% or near 0%.</p>
